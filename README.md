# my-task-app

A simple task manager application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   View a list of tasks
*   Add new tasks
*   Admin panel to view all tasks and their details

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **ORM:** Prisma (with SQLite)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd my-task-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Alternatively, if you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up the database:**
    The project uses Prisma with an SQLite database. The database file (`prisma/dev.db`) is included in the repository.

    *   **For initial setup or simple schema synchronization (common with SQLite where the DB file is committed):**
        After installing dependencies, the database should generally work out of the box. If you've changed your `prisma/schema.prisma` and want to quickly update your local SQLite database schema to match, you can use:
        ```bash
        npx prisma db push
        ```
        **Note:** `db push` is often used for rapid prototyping and does not create migration files. For a more structured database evolution with version control, use `prisma migrate dev`.

### Running Migrations

For managing database schema changes in a version-controlled manner, Prisma Migrate provides the following commands:

1.  **Create a new migration (during development):**
    When you change your `prisma/schema.prisma`, run this command to generate a new SQL migration file and apply it to your development database:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
    ```
    Replace `your_migration_name` with a descriptive name for your migration (e.g., `add_user_email_field`).

2.  **Apply migrations (in production or CI/CD):**
    To apply all pending migrations to your database (typically used in production, staging, or CI/CD environments):
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate deploy
    ```
    This command applies migrations that have been generated by `prisma migrate dev` and committed to version control. It does not generate new migrations or modify your schema file.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js's ESLint configuration.

## API Endpoints

The application uses the following API endpoints to manage tasks:

*   `GET /api/tasks`: Fetches all tasks.
*   `POST /api/tasks`: Creates a new task.
    *   Request body: `{ "title": "Your task title" }`

## Project Structure (Brief Overview)

*   `src/app/`: Main application code (pages, API routes).
    *   `src/app/page.tsx`: The main task view and add task interface.
    *   `src/app/admin/page.tsx`: The admin panel for viewing tasks.
    *   `src/app/api/tasks/`: API route handlers for task operations.
*   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
*   `prisma/`: Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) and database file (`dev.db`).
*   `public/`: Static assets.
